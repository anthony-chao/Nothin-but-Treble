# :musical_score: Treble-Sheet 

## Background
Treble Sheet is an app that allows users to drag notes onto a music sheet and play said notes. Users will have the ability to choose between different notes, type of notes, and instruments. This is an opportunity to learn how to practice reading and writing music by visually adding notes to a music sheet, and hearing the actual result.

## Functionality & MVPs
In Treble Sheet, users will be able to:
* Drag and drop notes on to the music sheet
* Play the music sheet using where each note is placed and what type of note it is
* Add, delete or reset music bars
* Learn how to read notes in Treble clef using built-in hover functionality

In addition, this project will include:
* Instructions on how to use Treble Sheet
* A Production README

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs
This project was implemented with the following technologies:
* HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Additionally, this project might utilize VexFlow, which is an open-source library for rendering music notation.

## Implementation Timeline

* Friday Afternoon & Weekend - create the music sheet and associate each row on the music sheet with a different note. Design the type of notes (quarter note, half note, whole note, etc.) and implement the hold and drop functionality on the music sheet. Add/associate audio files for each type of note and implement holding notes for more than just one beat.
* Monday - implement hover features for the notes on the music sheet and the type of notes for informational purposes. Add play/pause music, and add/delete/reset music bars buttons.
* Tuesday - adding different instruments and add additional functionality to change the time signature of the bars. Begin CSS styling
* Wednesday - finish up CSS styling and testing to ensure all essentially functionality implemented is properly working.
* Thursday Morning - continue polishing up CSS and functionality, and push to production.
